    Melvin Garcia helped me.
    Everything was great, he made all the changes I wanted (which were quite a few) and got everything right the first time.
    I'll rate him and consider the issue closed :) Thank you. 
    long-standing issues. Communication was fast and clear.

    I'll leave a short review of the service.
    Forum created in phpbb. Melvin did an excellent job selecting the theme and from an on-page SEO perspective for the forum. 
    He is also a user who pays attention to everything you ask him to change.
    Highly recommended.

    Excellent work, still working on details, because he leaves nothing undone (he corrected my mistakes and did his job).
    He is also very friendly and committed. Thank you, Melvin, we will definitely continue doing business together.

    I am leaving my review of the services provided by Melvin Garcia.
    First of all, I would like to say that the service I received from Melvin was excellent. 
    He was always available to help me via the forobeta chat, and was always friendly and patient. 
    He completed the work within the agreed timeframe, even earlier than he had estimated it would take.
    He demonstrates extensive knowledge on the subject and is open to any changes you may propose or to answer any questions you may have.
    In addition to this, which is no small thing, he gave me a “gift,” for which I am very grateful, and I will not hesitate to contact him when I need technical advice for my forum.
    You can trust 100% that he will not disappoint you. I recommend him without hesitation.

    Service contracted and received for installation and configuration of phpbb forum with Premod... service delivered very quickly. 
    I had already spent a whole day struggling with several errors that came up when installing Premod. 
    Totally satisfied with the service. Thank you.

    I asked Melvin for help placing an advertisement on my forum, and he assisted me without any issues. 
    He sent me a document explaining the steps to follow at a low price. Recommended.
